## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The ground clearance and vehicle length variables have a non-random, strong correlation between them and MPG according to the linear regression model.
The lines for the two correlating variables have significant slope, much different then 0. Although variables that donâ€™t show correlation tend to have smaller slopes closer to 0. 
The Multiple R-Squared value for this model is at 0.7, which is fairly high signifying an effective model for this data.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Design specifications for the suspension coils require the variance to not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Overall, this requirement is met at 62, but when considering the individual lots, the 3rd lot has a much greater variance then the other two. Without Lot 3, the overall variance would drop significantly to about 4.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Of the t-test results only the suspension coils at Lot 3 had a p-value of less the .05. This signifies that coils in Lot 3 have a statistically lower PSI than 1500.
